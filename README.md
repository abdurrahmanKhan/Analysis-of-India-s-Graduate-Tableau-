# Analysis-of-India-s-Graduate-Tableau-

The aim is to look at the relationship between population of states/cities with number of graduate and also look for correlation among the various facotrs. The data is used after the census report of 2011.

This project aims at analysing two problem statements through tableau -
1) Does Indiaâ€™s more populous states and cities have more graduates?
2) Does a high literacy mean there is a higher number of graduates in a city?


This search can be expanded by analysins Infant Mortality Rate(IMR) and Crude Death Rates (CDR) and also a % breakdown of house conditions like good, liveable, dilapidated. Due to data incompatibility it was not possible to analyse them in this project, but in my next project I'll be considering a vaste area for analysis.
